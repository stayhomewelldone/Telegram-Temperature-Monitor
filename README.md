# Telegram-Temperature-Monitor
Python script using Sense HAT to monitor temperature and send Telegram alerts for temperatures above a specified threshold.

The provided Python code presents a comprehensive script that interfaces with the Sense HAT sensor and integrates with the Telegram messaging platform to facilitate temperature monitoring and alerts. Through the utilization of the Sense HAT sensor, the script accurately measures the ambient temperature. Crucially, this script offers a configurable parameter, allowing users to define a specific temperature threshold. Whenever the measured temperature surpasses this predefined threshold, the script takes action by employing the Telegram Bot API to send a well-formatted alert message to a designated recipient or group. This seamless integration with Telegram enhances the practicality of the code, ensuring that temperature fluctuations beyond the set threshold are promptly communicated. Furthermore, the script showcases its versatility by incorporating the matplotlib library, enabling potential graphical representation of temperature data. In essence, this code amalgamates hardware interfacing, conditional logic, external API interaction, and potential data visualization, ultimately culminating in an effective temperature monitoring system with real-time Telegram notifications.
